# Nexus — Development Roadmap

## What Nexus Is

Nexus is not a Discord clone. It is the platform that comes **after** Discord — built for the moment people are finally ready to leave.

The UX should feel immediately familiar. Servers, channels, voice, bots, rich embeds. But Nexus is architecturally and philosophically a completely different thing:

- **Privacy is a guarantee, not a setting.** No ID, no phone, no face scan. Ever.
- **Your data stays yours.** Self-hostable. Exportable. No surveillance.
- **Its own protocol.** Not Discord-compatible. Not Matrix-compatible at the core. Bridges exist to help users *migrate away* from other platforms — not to maintain permanent compatibility.
- **IRC interop as an optional feature.** Users who want to connect via IRC can. It is not the core, it is a bridge.
- **Phantom as the long-term privacy backbone.** The [Phantom](https://github.com/The-No-Hands-company/Phantom) anonymous networking protocol will eventually be integrated to make privacy guarantees mathematical, not just policy.

### 08-05: Migration Bridges

> These are **one-way migration tools** to help communities move *to* Nexus from other platforms. They are not permanent compatibility layers and will never drive Nexus protocol decisions.

- ✅ Matrix Application Service bridge stub (read Matrix channels into Nexus during migration)
- ✅ Discord webhook bridge — incoming only (receive messages from Discord while migrating)
- ✅ Message relay (Nexus ↔ Matrix, for gradual community migration)

## Phase 9: Launch (v0.9) ✅ Complete

### 09-01: Deployment Infrastructure

- [x] Multi-stage production Dockerfile (minimal image)

## Phase 9.5: Lite / Zero-Infra Mode (v0.9.5) 🔲 Planned

> **Goal:** A single `nexus` binary you can download and run with zero external dependencies — no Postgres, no Redis, no Docker required. Install it, run it, invite friends to your server. The IRC model applied to Nexus.

### 09.5-01: Embedded Storage Backend

- [ ] Add `storage-lite` feature flag to `nexus-db`
- [ ] Swap Postgres for **SQLite** (`sqlx` SQLite driver, same migration files)
- [ ] Swap ScyllaDB for SQLite append-only messages table (partitioned by channel)
- [ ] Swap MinIO for local filesystem storage (`tokio::fs`, configurable path)
- [ ] Replace Redis pub/sub with in-process `tokio::sync::broadcast` channels
- [ ] Feature-gate the heavy backend crates behind `storage-full` (default for prod builds)

### 09.5-02: Embedded Search

- [ ] Replace Meilisearch with `tantivy` (embedded Rust full-text search engine)
- [ ] Index guilds, channels, users, messages in a local `tantivy` directory
- [ ] Keep Meilisearch path active when `NEXUS_SEARCH_URL` env var is set

### 09.5-03: Single-Binary Server Mode

- [ ] `nexus serve --lite` flag that activates embedded backends automatically
- [ ] Auto-create SQLite DB + data directories on first run
- [ ] Auto-generate secrets and write a `nexus.toml` config on first run
- [ ] Print a "Your server is running at http://localhost:8080" startup message

### 09.5-04: Lite Distribution

- [ ] GitHub Releases: attach pre-built `nexus-linux-x86_64`, `nexus-linux-aarch64`, `nexus-macos`, `nexus-windows.exe` binaries (via CI)
- [ ] Single-line install script: `curl -fsSL https://get.nexus.chat | sh`
- [ ] Update `docs/self-hosting.md` with a "Quick — no Docker" section at the top

## Phase 10: Mobile (v1.0)

- React Native iOS + Android
- Push notifications (FCM/APNs, self-hosted option via UnifiedPush — no Google dependency required)
- Voice/video on mobile
- Offline message queue (local store-and-forward, send on reconnect)

## Phase 11: Phantom Privacy Layer (v1.x — depends on Phantom maturity)

> **Depends on:** [Phantom](https://github.com/The-No-Hands-company/Phantom) reaching production readiness
> — a post-quantum anonymous networking protocol being developed in parallel.

This phase integrates Phantom into Nexus to make privacy guarantees **mathematical rather than policy-based**. Nodes routing traffic between Nexus servers will be unable to determine who is talking to whom, where messages originate, or which users are online — by cryptographic construction, not by trust in the operator.

Phantom is an infant today. This phase will happen when it is ready, not before.

### 11-01: Transport Integration

- [ ] Phantom as an optional transport layer for server-to-server federation traffic
- [ ] FHE-based oblivious routing so relay nodes learn nothing about the path
- [ ] Post-quantum key exchange on all Nexus connections (Kyber-1024 / X25519 hybrid)
- [ ] Phantom node embedded in the `nexus` binary (opt-in, can run as relay)

### 11-02: Anonymous Identity Layer

- [ ] Proof-of-personhood Sybil resistance (no government ID — cryptographic uniqueness)
- [ ] Anonymous account creation: accounts that are mathematically unlinkable to IP addresses
- [ ] Zero-knowledge login: authenticate without revealing which account you have

### 11-03: User-Facing Privacy Guarantees

- [ ] "Phantom mode" toggle per-server (routes traffic through the anonymous network)
- [ ] Verifiable privacy: users can independently verify that traffic is being handled correctly
- [ ] Threat model documentation that users can actually read and understand
